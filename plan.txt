MINIMAL:
get from point A to B.
no done button
lifting up resets path (like tutorial)
no grid, just max connect distance & minimum spacing of nodes
version A: no text, just node color range from white to full saturation of a color.
version B: hide node numbers, you have to figure it out.



TO DO:
-tutorial could be improved. Add stage where it teaches click vs swipe, and how to undo.
-throw out puzzles with solution lengths not what you want (important for difficulty).




Eventually:
-group levels into three difficulties (easy, medium, hard).
-reuse levels by adding mechanics (time limit, wilds, long chain, short chain, large number range, small number range, etc.).
-with just 5 levels of each difficulty, that becomes 90 levels!
