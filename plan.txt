Notes:
-timer hidden, but still time bonus.


TO DO:
-show star achievments on score screen.
-tutorial could be improved. Add sage where it teaches click vs swipe, and how to undo.
-throw out puzzles with solution lengths not what you want (important for difficulty).




Eventually:
-group levels into three difficulties (easy, medium, hard).
-reuse levels by adding mechanics (time limit, wilds, long chain, short chain, large number range, small number range, etc.).
-with just 5 levels of each difficulty, that becomes 90 levels!
